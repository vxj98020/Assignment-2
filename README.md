(a)Elasticity and Scalability in the Context of Cloud Computing for Deep Learning:  
• Elasticity:  
Elasticity within cloud computing pertains to a system's capability to adjust its resources—such as processing power, storage, and memory—dynamically based on real-time demand. In deep learning, elasticity guarantees that as computational requirements rise (for example, during model training), the cloud platform can automatically provision additional resources. Likewise, when demand diminishes (for instance, during inference or testing), the system can reduce its resource allocation, promoting cost-effectiveness. This adaptive resource management allows deep learning models to manage fluctuating workloads without requiring manual adjustments.
•	Scalability:  
Scalability refers to a system's ability to manage a growing workload or its capacity to be expanded to support that growth. In the context of deep learning, scalability empowers users to increase their computational resources (such as incorporating additional GPUs or CPUs) as the dataset size, model intricacy, or training time rises. For instance, scaling up allows for quicker model training, while scaling out (i.e., distributing tasks across several machines) can enhance parallel processing for extensive data analysis, thereby improving deep learning performance.
